# Getting Started

Welcome to FRC! This guide contains an in-order list of guides to get you setup to start programming (#^.^#). Note that this assumes you are using Java!

## Installing Software

To begin, you need to install some software. Listed below is the minimum needed to start working with a robot.

1. [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) - This contains a JDK, the WPILib library, Gradle, tools, and a specialized version of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that should be used while programming.
2. [FRC Gametools](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html) - This contains utilities used for interacting with a robot, such as DriverStation.

Additionally, you will want to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed if you intend on using version control, which is a must have if you are working with another person.
