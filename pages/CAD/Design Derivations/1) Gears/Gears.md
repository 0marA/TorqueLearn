### Jamming

Relevance: Gears that are positioned too close togehter can bind up and cause teeth to wear away faster.

Gears have an intrinsic property known as diamerial pitch *dp*. The diametrial pitch is defined as the the number of teeth on a gear *T* divided by the pitch diamter *d*. The pitch diameter is the diameter of a circle that intersects the teeth on the gear in the middle of the tooth height (technically it is when the tooth width is the same as the spacing between the teeth). Pitch diameter is easier explained with an image:
