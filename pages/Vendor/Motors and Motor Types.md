# Motors and Motor Types

### Brands and Models

As of the 2021 off-season, Texas Torque currently makes extensive use of RevRobotics NEO, NEO 550, VEX 775 pro, and is looking to incorporate the VEX Falcon 500 soon. In the past the team made use of the AndyMark CIM, but have since all but stopped using them in anything. All of these motors have features and quirks that make them suitable or unsuitable for specific roles.

### Brushless vs Brushed

These are the two main categories of DC motor. Both operate on the principals of electromagnetism and magnetism. The stator is the stationary part sourrounding the rotor, the rotating part. 

In a brushed motor, the stator is made up of two oppositely charged magnets facing inwards towards the rotor. The rotor is made up of coils that function as electromagnets. Attached to the rotor is the commutator, a periodically interrupted cylinder of metal. 2 carbon brushes contact the commutator passing current through it and into the coils on the rotor, attracting them towards the stator, producing rotational motion. At some point during the rotation of the motor, the brushes lose contact with the commutator, stopping the flow of current through the rotor and sending the motor into free spin. Then the brushes re-initiate contact with the commutator, causing current to flow in the opposite direction, reversing the polarity of the rotor's electromagnetic coils, and yet again attracting it to the stator. This finely tuned mechanical process ensures that the motor will keep spinning smoothly in the same direction. 

In a brushless motor, the rotor is still surrounded by a the stator, but the roles are reversed. The rotor is made up of a cylindrical magnet, attached to the load. An array of electromagnets point in from the stator towards the rotor (at least 3). A computer timing system switches the electromagnets on the stator on and off at the right time to continue attracting the rotor in the same direction.

For all intents and purposes, brushless motors are better then brushed motors. There are less durability concerns and less heat due to the lack of fragile brushes. They generally just perform better. For example, brushless motors have a higher torque-to-weight ratio.
